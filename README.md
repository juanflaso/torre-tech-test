# torre-tech-test

To test this app go to: https://torre-tech-jfl.herokuapp.com

### What is it?
 This is my vision of what an instagram/facebook like feed would look in torre. It shows job results mixed with suggestions of signals to people and organizations. It also uses a more natural way of searching for jobs that then gets translated to torre's search query.

### How to use it?

Just type naturally your skills. This test includes sime basic natural language processing so it should be able to handle some basic queries written naturally.
For best results, Ask yourself: "What skills and languages should my desired job have?". Examples of working queries are:

```
machine learning with 1 year of experience and fully fluent in english
```
```
software developer with 2 years of experience, 1 year of java and fluent english
```

**Notes:**
- I didn't implement a way to let you know that a request is on the way (sorry, was too excited to implement search!), so please be patient. The server requests torre's servers so the relaying part takes some time.
- Some data is mocked to reduce loading times. This includes, people's bio, Opportunities' banners, and opportunities' descriptions.
